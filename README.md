Graceful degradation refers to the idea where a web application still runs at an acceptable level even when certain features are not available. Service workers relate to this principle by utilizing caching to improve offline functionality when there is weak internet. This ensures that in a degraded condition like without internet, the web application still runs with core functionality.
